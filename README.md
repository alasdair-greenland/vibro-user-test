# vibro-user-test
User test for a system that allows users to send/received emoticons via trackpad/vibrations

How do different vibration patterns and touch-based input methods affect users’ accuracy, speed, and confidence when sending and receiving emoticon messages without visual or auditory cues?

- H₁: Distinct rhythmic vibration patterns (varying in duration + pauses) will yield higher recognition accuracy and faster response times than patterns differing only in intensity.

- H₂: Spatial click-based gestures on the trackpad (e.g., quadrant double-clicks) will be more accurate and faster to perform eyes-free than directional swipe-based gestures, because the spatial layout provides a stronger mental map of emoji positions.

## Key for inputs:
Version 1: Swipe Series
swipe-down = angry 😡
swipe-up = cry 😥
swipe-left = yay 😊
swipe-right = haha 😆
double-click = like 👍
long-click = heart ❤️
new-line = right-click

## Version 2: Click Series
double-top-left = haha 😆
double-top-right = yay 😊
double-bottom-left = cry 😥
double-bottom-right = angry 😡
right-click-top = like 👍
right-click-bottom = heart ❤️
# Method:
Each participant will complete all four combinations:
(Rhythm + Swipe)
(Rhythm + Click)
(Intensity + Swipe)
(Intensity + Click)

# Procedure
Training Phase:
- Before each condition, participants learn the current vibration encoding and input mapping through guided practice (≈2–3 minutes).
- They train until they can confidently identify and send each emoticon.

# Testing Phase:
- Each trial begins with a vibration pattern representing an emoticon.
- Participants respond using the assigned input method (swipe or quadrant click).
- The system records response time and accuracy.
- Each block includes one randomized presentation of all six emoticons (repeated twice).

# Breaks & Transitions:
- A short rest (≈1 minute) separates each block. (maybe survey after each block)
- After blocks they transition to the next method of input/output

# Post-Study Survey:
- After completing all blocks, participants rate perceived difficulty, confidence, and preference for each combination (1–5 Likert scales).
